- Some magic items require attunment
- If they do, the magical properties can't be used until attuned
- A creature can attune at most 3 items at once
  - Items that come in pairs (e.g. boots, or bracers) only take one of these attunement slots
- Attune by spending a short rest
  - Focus only on the item
  - Be in physical contact with the item
  - When attuned, a creature learns how to use the item, _including_ command words
- End attunement by
  - No longer satisfying a prerequisite
  - Being more than 100 feet away for 24 hours
  - Dying
  - Another creature attunes to the item
  - Voluntarially over a short rest
- An item can only be attuned to one creature at a time
