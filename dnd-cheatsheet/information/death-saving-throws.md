- At the start of your turn, when you have 0 hit points, you roll a d20 (with no modifier) to try to avoid dying.
  - Healing any hit points stops this process, bringing you back up
    - Temporary hp don't bring you back up
  - Rolling a 20 heals 1 hit point
  - Rolling a 1 counts as two failures
- Rolling a 10 or greater is a success
  - Reaching 3 successes means you're stabilised - you don't need to make any more checks (though you're still at 0 hp)
    - Unless healed, a stable creature regains 1 hit point in 1d4 hours
  - Reaching 3 failures means you're permanently dead
- Failures and successes are reset instantly when stable or healed
- Taking damage adds a failure
  - Taking a critical hit is 2 failures
  - While unconscious, attacks have advantage, and attacks from within 5 feet are automatic criticals
  - If you take more damage than your hit-point maximum, you automatically die
- A creature can make a DC 10 Medicine check to stablise another creature
