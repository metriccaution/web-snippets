# TODO

Possible ideas / features for this project.

The general approach here will be to see actual use with this project and then see how

## Saving changes to local storage

- Keep data in the browser's storage
- This should provide:
  - Resilience - Shutdowns won't lose data
  - Convinience - Allows for casual use without constantly saving / loading from file

## Multiple files in one session

- Some sort of tabbed view / file browser

## Load from / save to file

- Load from file w/ browser file API
- Download markdown
  - Can this be save to file name, or just download?
- Export all docs rather than one
  - I.e. as a zip or similar archive format

## Mindmapping

- Something like [Markmap-Lib](https://markmap.js.org/repl/)
- Easy viewing of document structure

## Developer Experience

### Build on push

- Github actions, or similar to build docs directory on commit, rather than requiring it to be done manually

### Source Maps / Debugging

### Rollup Dev Server

### Unit Testing

### Integration Testing
